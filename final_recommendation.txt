Final Recommendation – Marketing A/B Testing Project

This project evaluated the effectiveness of two marketing variants using A/B testing and hypothesis testing techniques in Python. Users were divided into control and test groups, and conversion was used as the primary performance metric.

The analysis showed that the test group achieved a higher conversion rate compared to the control group. Statistical testing using a Chi-Square test resulted in a p-value below the 0.05 significance level, indicating that the observed difference in conversion rates is statistically significant and unlikely to have occurred by random chance. Additionally, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in conversion rates did not include zero, further supporting the reliability of the result.

Based on these findings, the test marketing strategy demonstrates a positive and measurable impact on user conversions. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt the test campaign as the primary marketing approach.

To further improve marketing performance, it is recommended to:
1. Run follow-up A/B tests focusing on ad frequency, timing, and messaging.
2. Segment users by demographics or behavior to identify high-performing subgroups.
3. Monitor long-term conversion trends to ensure sustained impact.
4. Combine conversion analysis with revenue-based metrics for deeper business insights.

Overall, data-driven experimentation proved effective in optimizing marketing decisions and should be continued as part of the organization’s marketing strategy.
